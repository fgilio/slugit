# slugit

slugit is a handy URL based slug generator, try it out: [https://slugit.dev](https://slugit.dev)

## What?
Seriously, try it out: [https://slugit.dev/try it out](https://slugit.dev/try%20it%20out)

## Why
1. It's a simple tool I frequently needed when creating branch names from an issue's title.  
For example, imagine you have the following issue `Make slugit work offline`, then it's branch name would be `make-slugit-work-offline`.
2. I also needed a really simple project to learn how a Service Worker functions, so slugit actually does work offline.


## Usage
slugit is what I call a URL based slug generator, you use it by writing the original string in the URL and then the slug is generated. You can copy the slug by clicking it.  
There's also a text input if you prefer it and also in case you installed the app and lost the browser's URL bar.
